| 💵 [Analyze NYSE Data](link) | In this project, I performed EDA on S&P 500 financial data from the NYSE. From there, I created a P&L dashboard for each company and each year within the dataset, as well as a forecasting model for companies within a particular GICS Sub Industry over the next 2 years given 3 scenarios. Finally, I developed a presentation sharing and documenting the findings through several different types of visualizations. | <ul><li>Calculated summary statistics (measures of central tendency & spread)</li><li>Built a dynamic P&L dashboard & financial model using advanced functions (i.e INDEX, MATCH, OFFSET)</li><li>Created a series of visualizations communicating findings (i.e. bar charts, box-plots, scatterplots) </li>  |
